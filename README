BackupFilesTo is a simple utility for backing up podcast episodes downloaded
by gPodder (https://gpodder.github.io/) into another directory.

Often when podcatchers download files, the file names are attrocious and have
no relation to the episode title. I wanted a tool to put podcast episodes on a
USB stick so that I could listen to them without my phone, but manually moving
them was a pain.

So, I wrote this. To use it, set up your gpodder correctly, subscribe to some
podcasts, and download some episodes. You also need to have GPODDER_HOME and
GPODDER_DOWNLOAD_DIR in your environment.

Then, just run:

$ BackupPodcastsTo /path/to/put/podcast/episodes

The program will look at the gpodder database, find any episodes you've
downloaded, and then copy them to a directory beneath the specified path named
for the podcast, and the file name being the published date followed by the
episode title. If the destination does not support certain characters in file
names (such as :, ?, or other things windows filesystems do not support) it
will sanitize them, replacing them with _ instead.
